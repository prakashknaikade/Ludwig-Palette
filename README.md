# Ludwig-Palette
Our objective is to help visitors of the Ludwig church, a historical church in Saarbr√ºcken, explore the environment of the church in an entertaining way, 
we have created an AR-enabled painting app to be played inside the church. 
Players of this game need to walk to the different areas of the church while painting the surfaces. The app is developed using Unity and Vuforia engine.
You can find the video demo of the app [here](https://youtu.be/tHVaJKJuqXY).
